# Lipidomic association analyses with brain white matter microstructures
Scripts to run METABOLON CLP vs. brain microstructure phenotypes 

## Script instructions
1. Edit **[project_specific_inputs.R](project_specific_inputs.R)**

## Modifications
1. 2025-11-13: Created a script for generating correlation plots
2. 2025-11-14: Added scripts to generate correlation plots and lipidPC-loading tables

## To-Do
1. 2025-11-13: PCA of brain-WM associated lipids - what are the significantly loaded metabolites? (Are they correlated with concentrations? - Yes)
